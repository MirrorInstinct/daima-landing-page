        <p id="quote-text">Dragon Ball Daima, which will be rolled out in 2024, was originally 
            planned to be an original anime series without me, but as I gave 
            advice here and there, I ended up getting deeply involved with the 
            project without realizing it. I was not only involved in the overall 
            storyline, but also in the worldview, character design, mechas, and 
            other aspects. I hope you will enjoy watching the series, which I 
            believe is not only intense and action-packed, but also full of 
            plenty of substance.</p>
